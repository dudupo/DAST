\begin{definition} (connectivity)
  \label{def:connectivity}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $ G =\left( V,E \right)$ be a non-directed graph. A \textbf{connected component} of $G$ is a subset $U \subseteq V$ of maximal size in which there exists a path between every two vertices. 
\item A non-directed graph $G$ is said to be a \textbf{connected} graph if it only has one connected component.
\item Let $ G = \left(V, E\right)$ be a directed graph. A \textbf{strongly connected component} of $G$ is a subset $U \subseteq V$ of maximal size in which for any pair of vertices $u,v \in U$ there exist both directed path from $u$ to $v$ and a directed path form $v$ to $u$.   
\end{enumerate}
