\section{The Spanning Tree Problem.}


\begin{definition}
  A spanning tree $T$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is an edges subset of $E$ such that $T$ is a tree (having no cycles), and the graph $(V,T)$ is connected.   
\end{definition}

\begin{problem}[MST] Let $G = (V,E)$ be a weight graph with weight function $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Let's extends the weight for $E$'s subsets by defining for the weight of $X\subset E$ to be $w(X)= \sum_{e \in X}w(e)$. The minimum spanning tree of $G$ is the spanning tree of $G$ that has the minimal weight according to $w$.
\end{problem}

\begin{definition}
  Let $U \subset V$ we will define the cut associated by $U$ as the outer edges of $U$ we use the following $C = (U, \bar{U})$ to denote the cut.
